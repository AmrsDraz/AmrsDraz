- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Amr Draz
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in an entry level data science position. I have a 15 year background in mechanical engineering and am making a career shift into Data Science.
- ðŸŒ± I recently completed a data science bootcamp, Space Code. Here I gained skills in Python, SQL, MYSQL, Pandas, Tableau, Data Modeling, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. 

I am coming from a background in mechanical engineering. I have built a 15 year career in project management in various construction projects
and carry PMP, PMI-RMP, and EIT certifications. Through my experience I've developed technical, critical thinking, problem solving, communication and collaboration skills that will help me make a strong transition into the field of data science.

- I'm looking forward to connecting to discuss new opportunities!
